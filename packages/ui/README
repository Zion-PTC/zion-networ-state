# UI

This package containes utilities to build Fluid

## File syntax formatting.

We found that we prefer having the types as closes as
possible to the components. This means that, broadly
speaking, a component should look always somehow like this:

```ts
// IMPORTS
import { something } from "./somewhere";

type ComponentProps = {
  name: string;
};

export function Component() {
  return <div></div>;
}
```
