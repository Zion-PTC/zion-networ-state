## File syntax formatting.

We found that we prefer having the types as closes as
possible to the components. This means that, broadly
speaking, a component should look always somehow like this:

```ts
// IMPORTS
import { something } from "./somewhere";

type ComponentProps = {
  name: string;
};

export function Component() {
  return <div></div>;
}
```

# RULES

## Components

- shall have as first child a basic jsx element:

  ```ts
  ....
  return (
    <div><div>
  )
  ```

- shall all receive className from their props. This enables
  the possibility to use the component in `styled(Component)`.

  ```ts
  function Component(props:{className:string}){
    ....
    return (
      <div className{props.className}><div>
    )
  }
  ```

- shall receive datas which are going to be consumed by the
  component in a datas object:

  ```ts
  function Component(props: {
    datas: { text: string }[];
  }) {
    ....
  }
  ```

- when used in another component it shall not receive spread
  props looking like this:

  ```ts
  ...
  return (
    <div className={props.className}>
      <UsedComponent {...props} />
    </div>
  )
  ```

- should get props divided in two main types:
  - data: component data shall be wrapped in an array, in
    order to leverage the automatic factory functino which
    is in the `BaseNoiz` class. This means that the
    component can render multiple instances of itsels,
    simply by passing down more than one data object in
    the `props.datas` member.
    ```ts
    type ComponentData = {
      name: string;
      surname: string;
    };
    ```
  - booleans: component shall be configurable via
    booleans. For example `main`, or `big`, `small` ..etc.
    ```ts
    type ComponentBooleans = {
      main?: boolean;
      exotic: ?boolean;
    };
    ```
- should receive a prop object which looks like this:

  ```ts
  type ComponentProps = {
    datas: ComponentData[];
    main?: boolean;
    exotic?: boolean;
  };
  ```

- in order to make life easy I prepared some useful types
  which wrap datas with other usually required props
  members like `className`, `css` or
  `JSX.InstrinsicAttributes`. The final Component props
  shall look something like this:

  ```ts
  type ComponentProps = StyledDefault<{
    datas: ComponentData[];
    main?: boolean;
    exotic?: boolean;
  }>;
  ```

- Higher orderd components which import other components
  shall also provide a smart way to pass props downwards
  and avoid collisions. In order to do this Components
  should always provide a member, named as the child
  component, and should use the `ChildrenDatas` helper
  type which wraps data of a single child component into a
  `datas` objects. This shall be declared with the props:

  ```ts
  type HigherOrderComponent = StyledDefault<{
    datas: HigherOrderComponentData[];
    firemode?: boolean;
    ChildComponent: ChildDatas<ChildData>;
  }>;
  ```

- In the case the HigherOrder component has an higher
  order component child, it shall declare require all of
  the child components datas this ways:
  ```ts
  type HigherWithHigherComponent = StyledDefault<{
    datas: HigherWithHigherComponentData[];
    snowmode?: boolean;
    HigherChild: ChildDatas<HigherChildData> & {
      LowerChild1: ChildDatas<LowerChild1Data>;
      LowerChild2: ChildDatas<LowerChild2Data>;
    };
  }>;
  ```
