    They have been our overlords, and we, to them, are nothing but livestock. Their reign has been unquestionable and their acts of violence gone unpunished â€” until now. The citizens of the IGE have suffered this oppression long enough!

    Freedom Fighters! If we don't take the multiverse back, our universe is lost! This is a call to action. Will you stand with us and resist the cruelties and war crimes of our oppressors?`,
