functions of each Contract type that the application will be
able to handle.

# Technical

## Run the project.

Once downloaded the monorepo, run:

```sh
bolt
```

which is the equivalent of running `npm i`.
Then run this:

```sh
bolt build
```

This will start the building applications and packages.

> At the moment there is a bug with the building of next
> application which is related to the API call which happens
> in the `getStaticProps` function. This should be solved
> once the calls to retrieve datas will be forwarded to the
> blockchain.

In the root of the monorepo run `bolt nft-minter`.

## Open VsCode workspace

In the the folder of the application, at the relative root
level, there is a file `nft-minter.code-workspace` which is
convienent selection of folder to work on the nft-minter
application.
It contains:

- **nft-minter**: the package's root folder
- **pages**: the pages folder of the Next® application
  `src/pages`
- **lib**: the library folder `src/lib`
- **components**: the components folder `src/components`
- **ui**: the entire @zionstate/ui package folder, in order to
  quickly operate on the library itself.

## Work on the UI library

Working on the library requires a little extra-work:
each time we make a change and we wish to have it reflecting
in the browser we need to perform the following (in the
project's root folder, NOT in the monorepo root folder):

- `yarn run build`

This commands runs a script that I put in `./bin/build.sh`.
This folders shall be put global in your system in order for
it to work.

> Windows users shall install `git` utilities which has a
> replica of `bash` in order to run this scripts.
> I am working on the translation of those scripts in node
> scripts so that they can be easily run with no stress. Thats
> why I created the `CLI` application.

## Description

### Pfp

This contract type is, for example, the one which we will
use to distribute the Elsewhere© and Underlords© projects.

### Disclaimer

AAA this app is not working. At the moment is pretty broken
cause we are migrating the code to the library in order for
the application to be way thinned

We succesfully created classes for this pages:

- profile
- item

We are currently working on the integration of `.md` files.

We have some issues with exporting modules which use `fs`
from the packages and import them in client applications.

We created a next application inside the `ui` package to be
able to visualize every class that we create.
